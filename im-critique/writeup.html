    <h1>Evaluating Instant Messaging</h1>
    <p>
      In this section, I will evaluate Instant messaging app user interfaces
      based on the three usability dimensions(Learnability, Efficiency, Safety)
      and Graphic design. I will also use heuristics as part of my evaluation.
    </p>
    <!-- <p>
      While you <strong>need not to write</strong>st the formal heuristic
      evaluation reports of Exercise 2, you should still anchor your discussion
      in the heuristics and vocabulary discussed in class, not in subjective
      assessments like "this is hard to use" or "this is confusing".

      <h2>Telegram</h2>
      <!-- <p>Here I will discuss about Telegram</p> -->
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong> Threading:</strong> Telegram's thread messaging reduces
          Memory load. Users don't have to remember what they said because the
          threading keeps track of the conversation and makes it available.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong> Composing a new message:</strong> Telegram's explorable
          interface has made it easy to access the new message icon placed at
          the app's top right-hand corner. When users tap the new message icon,
          a window appears with multiple options to select, along with a search
          bar and a list of contacts in alphabetical order. Displaying the
          options would enhance the learnability and efficiency of the app
          because users can easily tap on the group chat, send it to a new
          contact, or choose to create a new channel to post it to; otherwise,
          they can select one individual from the list and start composing their
          message.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong> Search functionality:</strong> Telegram maintains consistency
          and discoverability by placing the search bar at the top of the screen
          throughout the page. It allows users to search for messages and
          contacts easily. In addition, When users type on the search bar,
          Telegram displays the most recent contacts and a small bar where users
          can select from chat, media, links or files, etc. this feature
          enhances both the learnability and efficiency of the app. on the other
          hand, when errors occur, such as misspelling Telegram doesn't offer an
          efficient error handling solution, i.e., autocorrect or autofill.
          Furthermore, the search results for common terms are overwhelming.
          While maintaining the good aspects of the search functionality, they
          can improve the search result by implementing filters or sorting
          options to help users find the most relevant content.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong> What errors can be made and what solution:</strong> Users
          could make several types of errors while using the Telegram app. Some
          examples are sending a message to the wrong person, leaving a group
          chat by accident, accidentally deleting or archiving a message,
          misspelling a search term, etc. Telegram has designed excellent error
          recovery methods for some of the user's accidental actions. For
          instance, it grants autonomy to the users to remove the messages they
          send; it prevents the deletion of a conversation by asking the users
          to confirm their actions (although it's not always efficient) if the
          users persist and delete or archive a conversation telegram offers a
          way to recover them back. Even though it is not very efficient,
          Telegram tried to incorporate Flexibility & efficiency. When users
          make a mistake by misspelling, the app yields a result closer to the
          input but less efficient than google or other autocorrect tools out
          there.

      <h2>WhatsApp</h2>
      <p>Here I will discuss about WhatsApp</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Threading: Unlike Telegram, I observed inconsistency in WhatsApp's
          threaded messaging. Sometimes, it lets me follow my conversation, and
          sometimes not. When threading is unavailable, users face a memory load
          where they have to scroll through their previous conversations to
          remember what they responded to or said a while back.
        </li>
        <li>
          composing a new message: composing a new message in WhatsApp is
          identical to Telegram.
