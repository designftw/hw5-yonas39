    <h1>Evaluating Instant Messaging UIs</h1>
    <article>
      <p>
        In this section, I will evaluate Instant messaging app user interfaces
        based on the three usability dimensions(Learnability, Efficiency,
        Safety) and Graphic design. I will also use heuristics as part of my
        response.
      </p>
    </article>
    <article>
      <p>
        From my observation, all three apps, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, and
        Telegram, have a threading functionality that helps users experience and
        improve efficiency and learnability. This design aligns with Nielson's
        heuristic of "recognition, not recall.". However, their specific
        implementation varies; they all have implemented a tool that helps users
        recognize their conversation instead of remembering (recalling) previous
        discussions. It improves efficiency, especially in long conversations or
        when a user wants to keep track of a specific topic in a group chat.
      </p>
      <p>
        Similarly, composing a new message across these apps is similar. I
        noticed consistency across the multiple apps using the same icon to
        represent "compose a new message." although they have some minor
        differences, their general graphics layout is similar. For instance,
        they placed the search bar and "compose a new message" icon at the top
        of the screen. Having a consistent layout across one platform or
        multiple applications facilitates the apps' learnability because when
        users transition from one app to the other, they don't have to unlearn
        their preexisting knowledge. In addition, all the apps adopt the
        "visibility of system status." heuristics. Users get the status of their
        message in real-time when they send it, when it's delivered, and when
        it's seen. It significantly improves the user experience because the
        users know what happens(status) during the process. On the other hand,
        compared to WhatsApp and messenger, Telegram has done a great job
        placing the contacts icon on their home page. This design choice of
        Telegram fulfilled Neilson's "match the real world." heuristics. since
        they are messaging and calling platforms displaying the contact as one
        of the options is widely known, and designing the product in such a way
        creates a pleasant experience for the user.
      </p>
      <p>
        One other thing they all have in common is error prevention and
        recovery. They all understood error is inevitable. People could type the
        wrong message, accidentally send messages to another person, delete a
        conversation, block someone by mistake, etc. are some of the errors
        people could make on this platform. When mistakes happen, they give
        autonomy and control to the user so that the user can erase the message
        they accidentally sent or unblock the person they accidentally blocked.
        Furthermore, when users try to delete some content, they will get a
        second chance to think about their action telegram and messenger wants
        the user to confirm the deletion. In contrast, WhatsApp provides an
        alternative to keep it in the archive than just deleting the file.

      <!-- Here I will discuss about Messenger -->
      <h2>Facebook Messenger</h2>
      <!-- <p>Here am going to write my observation on facebook messenger</p> -->

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong> Threading:</strong> The threading functionality in Facebook
          Messenger is an excellent example of the Nielsen Heuristics principle
          of "Flexibility and efficiency of use." By allowing users to organize
          their messages by conversation topics, Messenger provides a flexible
          and efficient way for users to manage their conversations and find
          specific information quickly. The nested conversation view, which
          displays threads as separate but related conversations within the main
          conversation view, is a great implementation of the "Recognition
          rather than recall" heuristic. This approach allows users to recognize
          and locate specific messages easily without having to recall the exact
          location of the message in the overall conversation. Furthermore, the
          customization options available for threads, such as muting
          notifications or leaving a thread, is a good example of the "User
          control and freedom" heuristic. By giving users the ability to tailor
          their messaging experience to their preferences, Messenger empowers
          them to take control of their conversations and customize their
          experience to best suit their needs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong> Compose a new message:</strong> Facebook messenger tried to
          address most of the Neielson heuristics principles. For instance, the
          "Visibility of system status" heuristic is implemented through
          Messenger's real-time display of message-sending status. When a user
          composes a new message, Messenger immediately shows a status indicator
          to the user, indicating whether the message is still sending or has
          been successfully sent or seen by the receiver. This allows the user
          to understand the system's status and progress in real time, reducing
          any uncertainty or confusion during the sending process. Another one
          is The "Match between the system and the real world" heuristic. It is
          addressed through Messenger's use of familiar language and symbols in
          the message composition process. The messaging interface uses
          recognizable symbols and terminology (such as the "send" button) that
          are commonly used in messaging applications. This makes it easy for
          users to understand and navigate the messaging interface, as it is
          consistent with their existing mental models of how messaging systems
          work. "Consistency and standards" is another heuristics example that
          is reflected in Messenger's consistent use of a simple and intuitive
          message composition interface across multiple platforms and devices.
          This ensures that users can quickly compose messages on any device
          without needing to re-learn the interface or switch to a different
          messaging app on a different device. While the Messenger message
          composition interface is generally simple, intuitive, and flexible to
          customize some features, it prevents the users from resizing text
          fonts while composing a text or reading inboxes. Providing users with
          the ability to customize the message composition interface (such as
          the ability to rearrange or resize elements) could help lots of users
          and grant them autonomy.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong> Search functionality:</strong> The "Visibility of system
          status" heuristic is addressed through Messenger's real-time display
          of search results. When a user enters a search query, Messenger
          immediately displays the search results in real time, allowing the
          user to quickly and easily see the search results as they are being
          generated. This reduces the user's cognitive load and helps them to
          stay informed about the system status throughout the search process.
          The "Match between system and the real world" heuristic is addressed
          through Messenger's use of natural language processing in the search
          function. The search interface uses familiar language and terminology,
          such as allowing users to search for specific keywords or phrases
          within their message history. This makes it easy for users to
          understand and navigate the search interface, as it is consistent with
          their existing mental models of how search systems work. The
          "Consistency and standards" heuristic is reflected in Messenger's
          consistent use of a simple and intuitive search interface across
          multiple platforms and devices. This ensures that users can quickly
          and easily find information on any device without needing to re-learn
          the interface or switch to a different messaging app on a different
          device.

          <strong>
            What errors can be made with this interface? What is the
            recoverability in case of errors? :</strong
          >
          There are several possible errors that users could make when using
          Facebook Messenger, such as sending a message to the wrong person,
          accidentally deleting a conversation or message, or mistakenly
          blocking a contact. However, the app provides a good safety feature to
          prevent these errors and help users recover if they make a mistake.
          For example, To prevent the accidental deletion of messages or
          conversations, Messenger allows users to archive conversations instead
          of deleting them. This allows users to hide conversations from their
          main message list without actually deleting them, providing an
          additional layer of protection against accidental deletion. In
          addition, if a user mistakenly blocks a contact, Messenger provides
          several options for unblocking the contact, including unblocking the
          contact directly from the chat thread or accessing the user's block
          list from Messenger's settings menu. This makes it easy for users to
          recover from a mistake and restore communication with a contact that
          was accidentally blocked. Furthermore, Messenger prevents us from
          receiving spam texts or unsolicited messages sent from strangers, but
          this feature is not always efficient because sometimes we see texts
          from our long-lost friends in the spam list. A separate bin containing
          the unsolicited message that displays the number of inboxes might be
          one solution. The users can see how many many inboxes are in there,
          and they can make a decision to look at them when there is a new
          inquiry(inbox).

        <li>
          <strong> Threading:</strong> the threading features of WhatsApp mimics
          the way conversations naturally unfold in the real world. It follows
          the Neilson heuristics of "Match the real world." WhatsApp threading
          is a messaging feature allowing users to organize and categorize
          conversations by creating threads or groups. This feature aligns with
          Nielsen's Heuristics of "Recognition rather than recall" and
          "Flexibility and efficiency of use." With recognition, the user can
          quickly identify the conversation thread they want to access without
          recalling it from memory. Users can also rapidly and efficiently
          navigate between different threads, enabling them to switch between
          conversations effortlessly, which adds to the app's usability. In
          addition, WhatsApp threading also incorporates the heuristic of
          "Aesthetic and minimalist design" as it streamlines the conversation
          interface, making it easy to comprehend and use. The user interface
          design provides a clear overview of all the user's threads, allowing
          them to determine which thread to access quickly.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong> Composing a new message:</strong> WhatsApp carefully
          integrates visibility of system status when writing a new message.
          When users open a conversation in WhatsApp, the system status is
          visible, indicating whether the conversation is active or archived.
          Users can see whether the recipient is online or offline when
          composing a new message. The app also shows the status of sent
          messages, including whether they have been delivered or read.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong> Search Functionality:</strong> WhatsApp's search
          functionality follows Nielsen's heuristics principles. For instance,
          it provides clear visual cues to indicate the system status. When
          users search for something, matching items will be displayed in
          real-time on the page and refined as the user types more specific
          texts, which helps reduce user frustration and improve their
          experience. It also gives users control and freedom over their search
          experience, with the app providing auto-suggestions and refining their
          search criteria. Moreover, the search functionality aligns well with
          the match between the system and the real-world principle. Users can
          search for specific keywords or phrases, and the app returns relevant
          messages and conversations, which aligns with how users naturally
          search for information in the real world. The search functionality is
          consistent and adheres to design standards, ensuring users can quickly
          find the information they seek without confusion.

            What errors can be made? what is the recovery in case of errors?
            :</strong
          >
          anyone can make an error. WhatsApp considered it and devised a
          solution for some potential mistakes the users could make. For
          example, usually, users review their message before sending it to
          ensure it goes to the correct recipient. But they might forget to
          double-check and send the message to the wrong recipient. In such
          instances, The app allows users to delete messages for themselves and
          the recipient, which can help recover from sending a message to the
          wrong person. Another possible error users may encounter accidentally
          deleting important messages or conversations. To prevent this,
          WhatsApp has implemented a second checkpoint to delete or archive the
          text. If the user persists and deletes the item, they designed a
          backup feature that automatically backs up all chats to the user's
          cloud storage. In case of a user error, such as accidentally deleting
          a message or conversation, the app allows them to restore their chats
          from the backup. This recovery feature aligns well with Nielsen's
          heuristics principle of error prevention and recovery, which suggests
          that software should make it easy for users to undo and recover from
          errors.

      <!-- Here I will discuss about Telegram -->
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong> Threading:</strong> Telegram's thread messaging reduces
          Memory load. Users don't have to remember what they said because the
          threading keeps track of the conversation and makes it available.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong> Composing a new message:</strong> Telegram's explorable
          interface has made it easy to access the new message icon placed at
          the app's top right-hand corner. When users tap the new message icon,
          a window appears with multiple options to select, along with a search
          bar and a list of contacts in alphabetical order. Displaying the
          options would enhance the learnability and efficiency of the app
          because users can easily choose from the options to send a group chat,
          send to a new contact, choose to publish it in their channel or they
          can select one individual from the list and start composing their
          message.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong> Search functionality:</strong> Telegram maintains consistency
          and discoverability by placing the search bar at the top of the screen
          throughout the page. It allows users to search for messages and
          contacts easily. In addition, When users type on the search bar,
          Telegram displays the most recent contacts and a small bar where users
          can select from chat, media, links or files, etc. this feature
          enhances both the learnability and efficiency of the app. on the other
          hand, when errors occur, such as misspelling Telegram doesn't offer an
          efficient error handling solution, i.e., autocorrect or autofill.
          Furthermore, the search results for common terms are overwhelming.
          While maintaining the good aspects of the search functionality, they
          can improve the search result by implementing filters or sorting
          options to help users find the most relevant content.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong> What errors can be made and what solution:</strong> Users
          could make several types of errors while using the Telegram app. Some
          examples are sending a message to the wrong person, leaving a group
          chat by accident, accidentally deleting or archiving a message,
          misspelling a search term, etc. Telegram has designed excellent error
          recovery methods for some of the user's accidental actions. For
          instance, it grants autonomy to the users to remove the messages they
          send; it prevents the deletion of a conversation by asking the users
          to confirm their actions (although it's not always efficient) if the
          users persist and delete or archive a conversation telegram offers a
          way to recover them back. Even though it is not very efficient,
          Telegram tried to incorporate Flexibility & efficiency. When users
          make a mistake by misspelling, the app yields a result closer to the
          input but less efficient than google or other autocorrect tools out
          there.
