          Engineering Student at MIT. I have always been passionate about
          Technology and have dedicated my life to study technology, math and
          science. In my free time, I enjoy reading books, wrting computer
          programs, playing soccer, and spending time with my family which has

          believer in giving back to the community and have been involved in
          math tutoring in a local community learning center. My ultimate goal
