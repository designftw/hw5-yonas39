    <h1>Critique another student Expense App</h1>
    <article>
      <p>
        Problem 1: Problem: Poor Data ValidationHeuristic: Nielsen's heuristic -
        Error prevention Description: The app does not provide any data
        validation for the user input fields. For example, the "Cost" field does
        not have a minimum or maximum limit, which can lead to incorrect data
        being entered. Severity: Major Recommendation: Implement data validation
        to prevent incorrect data from being entered. For example, the "Cost"
        field should have a minimum and maximum limit to prevent invalid data
        from being entered. Additionally, the app should highlight any fields
        with incorrect or missing data to prompt the user to correct them.
      </p>

        Problem 2: Lack of error messages Heuristic: Nielsen's error prevention
        Description: The application does not provide adequate error messages.
        When users make an error, the application does not provide feedback that
        helps them correct it. Severity: Major Recommendation: Add error
        messages that notify the user when they have made an error and how to
        correct it. For example, the application should notify users when they
        forget to fill out a required field.
      </p>
      <p>
        Problem 3: No feedback for action completion Heuristic: Nielsen's
        visibility of system status Description: The application does not
        provide feedback to the user after completing an action. For example,
        after adding an expense, the user does not receive a confirmation
        message or any feedback indicating that the expense has been added
        successfully. Severity: Moderate Recommendation: Provide feedback to the
        user after completing an action. For example, the application could
        display a confirmation message after adding an expense.
      </p>

      <p>
        Problem 4: Lack of clear labeling Heuristic: Nielsen Heuristics -
        Recognition rather than recall Description: The application has unclear
        labeling for input fields and buttons, which can lead to user confusion.
        The user must remember what each button does and the purpose of each
        input field. Severity: Moderate Recommendation: Provide clear labeling
        for each input field and button to ensure the user understands their
        purpose. Consider adding tooltips or hints to provide additional context
        and guidance for the user.
