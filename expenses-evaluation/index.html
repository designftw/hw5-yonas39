	    <h1>Critique another student Expense App</h1>
    <article>
      <p>
        Problem 1: Poorly labeled buttons Heuristic: Nielsen's visibility of
        system status Description: The application has two buttons with the same
        label "Login". It is confusing to know what each button does. Also, the
        "add" button has no text to indicate what it adds, and its position
        within the app is not clear. Severity: Moderate Recommendation: Rename
        one of the "Login" buttons to something more specific, such as "Log in
        to Expenses" and "Log in to History." Add descriptive text to the "add"
        button, such as "Add Expense."
      </p>
      <p>
        Problem 2: Inconsistent and inadequate visual design Heuristic:
        Nielsen's aesthetic and minimalist design Description: The application's
        visual design is inconsistent and lacks adequate spacing, alignment, and
        contrast. The background color, font size, and color are not optimal for
        reading. Severity: Major Recommendation: The design should be reviewed
        and updated to ensure adequate contrast, alignment, and spacing. This
        may include using a consistent background color, using a larger font
        size, and using high-contrast text colors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Problem 3: Inefficient interface Heuristic: Nielsen's efficiency of use
        Description: The application requires multiple clicks to complete common
        tasks. For instance, the user has to click on the "save all" button
        after editing each expense item. Additionally, the application could
        automatically save changes, rather than requiring the user to manually
        save after each change. Severity: Moderate Recommendation: Allow the
        user to save changes automatically without clicking a button. Also,
        implement a batch saving feature that allows users to edit multiple
        expenses and save all of them at once.
      </p>
      <p>
        Problem 4: Lack of error messages Heuristic: Nielsen's error prevention
        Description: The application does not provide adequate error messages.
        When users make an error, the application does not provide feedback that
        helps them correct it. Severity: Major Recommendation: Add error
        messages that notify the user when they have made an error and how to
        correct it. For example, the application should notify users when they
        forget to fill out a required field.
      </p>
      <p>
        Problem 5: Ambiguous labeling Heuristic: Tognazzini's First Principles
        Description: The application uses unclear labeling for some of its
        buttons and fields. For example, the "clear_balance" button is
        ambiguous; users may not understand what this button does without
        additional context. Severity: Moderate Recommendation: Use clear,
        descriptive labels for buttons and fields to make it easier for users to
        understand what they do. For example, the "clear_balance" button could
        be renamed to "Settle All Debts."
      </p>
      <p>
        Problem 6: No feedback for action completion Heuristic: Nielsen's
        visibility of system status Description: The application does not
        provide feedback to the user after completing an action. For example,
        after adding an expense, the user does not receive a confirmation
        message or any feedback indicating that the expense has been added
        successfully. Severity: Moderate Recommendation: Provide feedback to the
        user after completing an action. For example, the application could
        display a confirmation message after adding an expense.
